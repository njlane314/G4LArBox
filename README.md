# G4LArBox: Geant4 Liquid Argon Box Simulation

## Description
G4LArBox is a Geant4-based simulation toolkit that aims to model particle interactions in a 'box' liquid argon environment. It is designed as a tool for particle physics research of novel liquid-argon detector concepts, specifically related to rare event searches.
